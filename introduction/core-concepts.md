In Cortex CMS, a `ContentType` allows administrators to define 

Unlike systems that hardcode your basic content types out of the box - such as Blogposts, Media, and so on - and require you to create tightly coupled plugins to mix in additional functionality, Cortex CMS allows you to compose your content types from the ground up, specific to each business case. Every field is built as part of a plugin, allowing you to extend the system without directly modifying the 'core' platform.
