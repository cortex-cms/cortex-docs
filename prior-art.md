# Prior Art

Cortex CMS is inspired by many CMSs already in the wild, including but not limited to:

* [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) - By far the most popular CMS due to its inherent simplicity and great [content creator](glossary.md#content-creator) experience. Lacks flexibility and advanced distribution.
* [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) - Supports slightly more advanced distribution models, but lacks a great [content creator](glossary.md#content-creator) experience, is not headless \(lacks an API, so it does not support more advanced distribution\), and can be very difficult to maintain and scale.
* [HippoCMS](https://www.onehippo.org/) - Supports advanced distribution models, features a novel backend \([JCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_repository_API_for_Java)\), is headless, but is unwieldy and Java-based.
* [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) - Supports advanced distribution models and is headless, but lacks a great [content creator](glossary.md#content-creator) experience and is closed-source. Is the closest to our vision, but falls just short.
* [Prismic](https://prismic.io/) - similar to Contentful, but isn't quite as feature-rich, and is also closed source.
