# Glossary

###### CMS

At its core, a Content Management System allows for the creation & distribution of content across media devices. With more advanced tools, such as Cortex CMS, a CMS can also provide dynamic content recommendations to end-users, an API for _integration engineers_ to work with when consuming content, reporting, localizations, advanced distribution and much more.

###### Content Creator

The primary customer a CMS serves is the content creator, who authors the rich content experiences necessary for end-users to be delighted by the product, whether it be a blog, a website, or something more - a smartphone app, an advertising platform, or even a car's dashboard.

###### Superadministrator

The glue putting together all the pieces across the CMS - this user creates or manages the various `ContentTypes`, plugins, tenants and users available to every other role.
