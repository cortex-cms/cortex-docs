Cortex [CMS](/glossary.md#cms) is a [multitenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy) identity, custom content distribution/management and reporting platform built by the [Content Enablement](https://github.com/cb-talent-development) team at [CareerBuilder](https://github.com/careerbuilder). Its purpose is to provide central infrastructure for next-generation applications; exposing a single point of management while enabling quicker build-out of new software.

Cortex adheres to a headless, API-only architecture - it avoids a monolithic, all-in-one architecture associated with CMSs like WordPress or Drupal.
