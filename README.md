Cortex CMS is a [multitenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy) identity, content distribution/management and reporting platform built by the [Content Enablement][cb-ce-github] team at [CareerBuilder](https://github.com/careerbuilder). Its purpose is to provide central infrastructure for next-generation applications; exposing a single point of management while enabling quicker build-out of new software.

Cortex follows a decentralized, API-only architecture - it is *not* built like Wordpress or Drupal, which are considered monolithic, all-in-one solutions.

## Setup

### Environment

Copy and rename the example `.env.example` file as `.env` and modify it to match your environment.

For a rudimentary setup, these variables should be configured:

* Execute `$ bundle exec rails secret` twice to generate both an `APP_SECRET` and `DEVISE_SECRET`
* If the superuser isn't used for the app databases, the `DATABASE_USERNAME` and `DATABASE_PASSWORD` should be set accordingly.

### Dependencies

#### System

##### OS X

* Install the Xcode Command Line tools:

```sh
$ xcode-select --install
```

* Install all Cortex system-wide dependencies (and the `readline` Ruby/`byebug` build dependency) using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) from the `Brewfile` via `$ brew install $(cat Brewfile|grep -v "#")`
* Install Ruby via [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [rvm](https://rvm.io/).
* Enable system agents:

```sh
$ ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
$ ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/elasticsearch/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
$ ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/redis/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
```

and start them with `brew services`:

```sh
$ brew services start postgresql
$ brew services start elasticsearch
$ brew services start redis
```

or `launchctl`:

```sh
$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.elasticsearch.plist
$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist
```

##### Linux

* Install all Cortex system-wide dependencies (and the `readline` Ruby/`byebug` build dependency) using your distribution's package manager (`pacman`, `apt-get`, `yum`, etc). For example, with Ubuntu's `apt-get`:

```sh
$ apt-get install libreadline6-dev postgresql postgresql-contrib redis-server openjdk-8-jre imagemagick jpegoptim ghostscript
```

Ubuntu and Redhat/Fedora do not have an official `elasticsearch` package - you must use Elasticsearch's [repository](https://www.elastic.co/blog/apt-and-yum-repositories) or follow these [instructions](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch#installation). The same goes for `phantomjs`. Build from [source](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) or use a [PPA](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas?name_filter=phantomjs). Other Linux distributions likely have these as prebuilt packages in their official or user repositories.

* Install Ruby via [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [rvm](https://rvm.io/).
* Enable system agents using your distribution's service manager frontend, which is likely `systemd`'s frontend, `systemctl`:

```sh
$ systemctl enable postgresql
$ systemctl enable elasticsearch
$ systemctl enable redis
```

and start them with `systemctl`:

```sh
$ systemctl start postgresql
$ systemctl start elasticsearch
$ systemctl start redis
```

#### Application

* Install Bundler and its dependencies:

```sh
$ gem install bundler && bundle install
```

* Install `node` dependencies (including `bower`) and use `bower-rails`'s rake task to install dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install && bundle exec rake bower:install:development
```

### Database

* Create databases:

```sh
$ bundle exec rake db:create
```

* Initialize the schema:

```sh
$ bundle exec rake db:schema:load
```

* Seed database with a top-level tenant, the superuser and Custom Content data, then rebuild the ElasticSearch index:

```sh
$ bundle exec rake db:seed
$ bundle exec rake cortex:core:db:reseed
$ bundle exec rake cortex:rebuild_indexes
```

### Server

Start Cortex, Sidekiq and live rebuild of Webpack scripts via Foreman:

```sh
$ foreman start -f Procfile.dev
```

The admin interface should now be accessible locally on port `3000`. To access Cortex as superadmin, login as `admin@cortexcms.org` with password `welcome1`.

### Deployment

To use an automated tool to deploy the server, set this environmental variable:

```shell
CI=true
```

This will suppress Bower's interactive request to enable insights/metrics reporting, which normally prevents the CI process from continuing.

Additionally, deploying the `development` environment as a non-local server will require an additional environmental variable be set:

```shell
DEPLOYED=true
```

This will configure various things, such as [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) to behave normally in a deployed scenario.

## Running Test Suite

Initialize the test database:

```sh
$ RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:schema:load db:seed cortex:core:db:reseed
$ RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake cortex:rebuild_indexes
```

To run Ruby and JS specs, utilize:

```sh
$ RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake spec
$ RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake spec:javascript
```

## API

### Documentation

Cortex's live API documentation is available via Swagger. This contains specific endpoints, parameters, and response models.

SwaggerUI is provided at [http://docs.api.cbcortex.com/](http://docs.api.cbcortex.com).

Swagger Endpoints are available at [http://api.cbcortex.com/api/v1/swagger_doc.json](http://api.cbcortex.com/api/v1/swagger_doc.json).

## Consuming Cortex

### Authorization

Cortex's API utilizes [OAuth2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) for Authentication and Authorization. Client Credentials and Authorization Code [grant types](http://alexbilbie.com/2013/02/a-guide-to-oauth-2-grants/) are supported. Want to get up and running quickly with OAuth? Use Cortex's [Ruby client](https://github.com/cortex-cms/cortex-client-ruby) or [OmniAuth strategy](https://github.com/cb-talent-development/omniauth-cortex) for Client Credentials and Authorization Code grants, respectively.

Review the `optional_scopes` in Cortex's [Doorkeeper config](https://github.com/cbdr/cortex/blob/master/config/initializers/doorkeeper.rb) to determine the available scopes, and the [API Resource classes](https://github.com/cbdr/cortex/tree/master/app/api/v1/resources) to determine where they're required.

Before an application can consume any data, OAuth credentials must be created for the consuming application in the 'Applications' section of the Cortex admin interface.

### Content

Content can be consumed from a feed or via the resource's endpoint directly. Use the [cortex-client](https://github.com/cbdr/cortex-client) gem to easily consume any content resource and use it in your application.

### Localizations

Localizations can be consumed via the client or via [i18n-backend-cortex](https://github.com/cortex-cms/i18n-backend-cortex), which allows easy localization for Rails applications.

### Exceptions

If a consuming or companion application would like to produce Cortex-equivalent exceptions, use the [cortex-exceptions](https://github.com/cb-talent-development/cortex-exceptions) gem.

## Troubleshooting
* For OS X / homebrew users: Run `which node` to ensure node is properly linked. The path shown should match homebrew's default installation path (run `which brew` to reveal this). If its not, then run `brew link node` and follow the instructions.
